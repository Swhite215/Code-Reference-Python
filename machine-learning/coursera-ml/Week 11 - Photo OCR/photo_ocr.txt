Photo OCR

1. Photo OCR
    - Problem Description and Pipeline
        - Photo Optical Character Recognition - (Difficult)
        - Actions/OCR Pipeline
            - Identify Text
            - Character Segmentation
            - Character Classification
    - Sliding Windows
        - Detection
            - Pedestrian Detection - find individual pedestrians in the image. easier due to aspect ration height x width ration
                - Select aspect ratio
                - Collect training set of positive and negative examples
                - Sliding Window Detection
                    - Take rectangular patch, run through classifier
                    - Slide patch to the left, run through classifier
                    - Amount shifting - called stepsize or stride
                    - Increase patch size, take image, resize image, pass through classifier
            - Text Detection
                - Collect training set of positive and negative examples
                - Sliding Window Detection - identify regions where possible text
                - Apply Expansion Operator - takes region image and expands white region of possible text
                - Eliminate Areas
                - Draw Bounding Boxes
                - Sliding Window Detection - Character Segmentation - Identify Splits Between Chars
    - Getting Lots of Data and Artificial Data
