Photo OCR

1. Photo OCR
    - Problem Description and Pipeline
        - Photo Optical Character Recognition - (Difficult)
        - Actions/OCR Pipeline
            - Identify Text
            - Character Segmentation
            - Character Classification
    - Sliding Windows
        - Detection
            - Pedestrian Detection - find individual pedestrians in the image. easier due to aspect ration height x width ration
                - Select aspect ratio
                - Collect training set of positive and negative examples
                - Sliding Window Detection
                    - Take rectangular patch, run through classifier
                    - Slide patch to the left, run through classifier
                    - Amount shifting - called stepsize or stride
                    - Increase patch size, take image, resize image, pass through classifier
            - Text Detection
                - Collect training set of positive and negative examples
                - Sliding Window Detection - identify regions where possible text
                - Apply Expansion Operator - takes region image and expands white region of possible text
                - Eliminate Areas
                - Draw Bounding Boxes
                - Sliding Window Detection - Character Segmentation - Identify Splits Between Chars
    - Getting Lots of Data and Artificial Data
        - Artificial Data Synthesis
            - Create New Data - e.g. find characters from different font sets and place on varying backgrounds
            - Amplify Small Training Set - e.g. introduce distortions to original data - audio, visual, etc.
                - Issues - distortion should be representative of the type of distortion in the dataset
                - Usually does not help to add purely random/meaningless noise to your data
        - Getting More Date
            - Make sure you have a low bias classifier before expending the effort i.e. plot learning curves
            - Ask - How much work would it be to get 10x as much data as we currently have?
                - Aritifical data synthesis
                - Collect/label it yourself
                - Crowd Source
    - Ceiling Analysis - What Part of the Pipeline to Work on Next
        - Photo OCR Pipeline - Image -> Text Detection -> Character Segmentation -> Character Recognition
        - Question - What part of the pipeline should you spend the most time trying to improve?
        - Idea
            - #1 - generate single metric e.g. overall system accuracy
            - #2 - monkey around in test set, manually tell algorithm where text is, simulate 100% accuracy
            - #3 - run modified data through pipeline and measure single metric, compare to original metric
