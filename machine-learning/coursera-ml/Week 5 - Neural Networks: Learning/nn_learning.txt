Neural Networks - Learning

1. Cost Function and Backpropogation
    - Cost Function
        - Binary Classification - one output unit with output of h(x) is real number
        - Multiclass Classification - output vectors that are k-dimensional
         - Logistic Regression with Lambda Regularization Term
    - Backpropogation Algorithm - minimize the cost function
        - Given one training example (x,y)
            - Forward Propogation
        - Backpropogation
    - Backpropogation Intuition
