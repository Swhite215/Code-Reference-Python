Neural Networks - Representation

1. Motivations
    - Non-Linear Hypotheses
        - Non-Linear Classification
            - Logistic Regression w/ Non-Linear Features
                - Works well with low number of features
        - Example - Determining Image Category
        - Issue - Learning Complex Non-Linear Hypotheses with High Number of Features
    - Neurons and the Brain
        - Origins - algorithms trying to mimic the brain, widely used in 80s and 90s, began to diminish, recent resurgence
        - One Learning Algorithm Hypothesis - Neuro-rewiring
            - Auditory Cortex Learns to See (Hearing -> Seeing)
            - Somatosensory Cortext Learns to See (Touching -> Seeing)
        - Examples
            - Seeing with Tongue
            - Human Echolocation
            - Haptic Belt
            - Third Eye

2. Neural Networks
    - Model Representation - Simulation of Neuron/Network of Neurons
        - Neuron in Brain
            - Input Wires - Dendrite
            - Brain - Nucleus - Perfoms Operation
            - Output Wire - Axon
            - Messages = Pulse of Electricity
        - Neuron Logistic Unit - 
            - x1 - xn inputs
            - Operation
            - output - hypothesis - h(x) - sigmoid (logistic) activation function
            - x0 - bias unit
            - weights = parameters
        - Neural Network
            - Group of Neuron Logistic Units
            - Layer 1 - Input Layer for Features
            - Layer In-Between - Hidden Layer - Activation Units
            - Final Layer - Output Layer
        - Neural Network Computational Steps
            - Activation of Unit I in Layer J aij
            - ThetaJ - matrix of weights controlling function mapping from layer j to layer j + 1
            - Dimensions - If network has sj units in layer j, sj+1 units in layer j + 1, then thetaJ will be of dimension sj+1 x (sj+1)
    - Model Representation II
        - Forward Propagation - Vectorized Implementation
        - Input -> Hidden Layers -> Output Layer
