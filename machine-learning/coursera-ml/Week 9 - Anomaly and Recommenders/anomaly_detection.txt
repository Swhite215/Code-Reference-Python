Anomaly Detection

1. Density Estimation
    - Problem Motivation
        - Can we predict whether something is anomalous?
        - Formally: given dataset, these examples are normal, is new example anomalous?
        - Action
            - Build a model for the probability of x
            - If P(x) test < Epsilon -> flag as anomaly
            - If P(x) test >= Epsilon -> OK
            - Density - high to low expanding circle
        - Examples
            - Fraud Detection
            - Manufacturing Errors
            - Monitoring Computers in Data Centers
                - Features of Each Machine
                    - Memory Use, Disk Access, CPU Load, Network Traffice
                - Model p(x) of unusual behavior of machine
    - Gaussian Distribution
        - If x is a distributed Gaussian with mean u, and variance sigma^2, then plotted it looks like a bell shape curve
        - Gaussian Formula - look it up
        - Mu - center of gaussian distribution, variance - low, tall curve, high, wide curve
    - Anomaly Detection Algorithm
        - Assume - x is distributed according to Gaussian distribution with some mu and variance
        - For each training example, separate mu and variance parameters
        - P(x) - Product of j=1 to n of p(xj, muj, variance^2j)
        - Steps
            - Choose features that might be indicative of anomalous examples
            - Fit parameters mu and variance
            - Give new example, compute p(x) - Gaussian Formula
            - Anomalyu if p(x) < epsilon

2. Building an Anomaly Detection System
    - Developing and Evaluating an Anomaly Detection System
        - Importance of Real Number Evaluation - when developing an algorithm, make decisions is much easier if we have a way of evaluating our learning algorithm
        - Assume we have labeleed data, y = 0 if normal, y = 1 if anomalous
        - Training Set - assume normal examples/not anomalous
        - Cross Validation Set - (Xcv, Ycv)
        - Test Set - (Xtest, YTest)
        - Example
            - 10000 good normal engines (normal)
            - 20 flawed engines (anomalous)
            - Training Set - 6000 good engines
            - CV - 2000 good engines, 10 anomalous
            - Test Set - 2000 good engines, 10 anomalous
        - Algorithm Evaluation
            - Fit model p(x) on training set
            - On cross validation/test example x, predict
                - y = 1, if p(x) < epsilon = anomaly
                - y = 0, if p(x) >= epsilon = normal
            - Possible Evaluation Metrics
                - True Positive, False Positive, False Negative, True Negative
                - Precision/Recall
                - F1 Score
