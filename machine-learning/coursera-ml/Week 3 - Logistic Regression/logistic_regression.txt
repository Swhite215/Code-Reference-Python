Logistic Regression

1. Logistic Regression
    - Classification (Binary Classification)
        - Goal - variable y that you want to predict is discrete valued i.e 0 or 1
        - Examples
            - Email - spam/not spam
            - Online Transactions - fraudulent Y/N
            - Tumors - malignant/benign
        - Classes
            - 0 - Negative Class (Absence)
            - 1 - Positive Class (Presence)
        - Future - Multi-Class Problems e.g. y is 0,1,2,3,4
        - Threshold Classifier
            - if hypothesis >= 0.5 then predict y = 1
            - if hypothesis < 0.5, then predict y = 0
        - Issue with Linear Regression - hypothesis can be greater than 1 or less than 0
    - Hypothesis Representation
        - Desire - predictions are between 0 and 1
        - Modified Hypothesis g(theta transpose X)
        - Sigmoid/Logistic Function: g(z) = 1 / (1 + e^-7)
        - Hypothesis h(x) = 1 / (1 + e^-theta'x)
        - Interpretation of Hypothesis Output
            - Treat h(x) as the estimated probability that y = 1 on input x e.g. h(x) = .7 means 70% chance of being malignant
            - h(x) = P(y = 1 | x; theta) i.e. probability that y = 1, given x, parameterized by theta
            - P(y = 0 | x; theta) = 1 - P(y = 1 | x; theta)
    - Decision Boundary
        - if hypothesis >= 0.5 then predict y = 1
        - if hypothesis < 0.5, then predict y = 0
        - g(z) >= .5 when Z >= 0 which means g(theta'x) >= 0.5 when theta'x >= 0
        - g(z) < .5 when Z < 0 which means g(theta'x) < 0.5 when theta'x < 0
        - Example
            - hypothesis = g(theta0 + theta1X1 + theta1X2)
            - theta0 = -1, theta1 = 1, theta2 = 1
            - theta = [-3; 1; 1]
            - y = 1 if -3+x1+x2 >= 0
            - Rewrite as x1 + x2 >= 3
            - Plot x1 + x2 = 3 as a line
            - Region above line is where hypothesis will predict 1
            - Region below line is where hypothesis will predict 0
            - x1 + x2 = 3 Line is decision boundary that is where hypothesis prediction is 0.5
            - Decision Boundary is property of hypothesis
        - Can be linear, circular, elliptical, etc.
        - Important - Decision boundary is a property of the hypothesis, not the data
