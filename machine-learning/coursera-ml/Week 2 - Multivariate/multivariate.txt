Multivariate Linear Regression

1. Multivariate Linear Regression
    - Multiple Features
        - Example - house price based on number of bedrooms, age of house, size of home
        -  Terms
            - m - number of rows
            - n - number of features
            - Xᵢ - feature
            - Xⁱ - vector of features for specific training example
        - New Hypothesis - h(x)  = θ₀X₀ + θ₁Xᵢ + ... + θnXn
            - θTX - row vector parameters times vector of x's
