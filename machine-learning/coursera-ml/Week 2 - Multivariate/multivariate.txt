Multivariate Linear Regression

1. Multivariate Linear Regression
    - Multiple Features
        - Example - house price based on number of bedrooms, age of house, size of home
        -  Terms
            - m - number of rows
            - n - number of features
            - Xᵢ - feature
            - Xⁱ - vector of features for specific training example
        - New Hypothesis - h(x)  = θ₀X₀ + θ₁Xᵢ + ... + θnXn
            - θTX - row vector parameters times vector of x's
    - Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables
    - Gradient Descent in Practice 1: Feature Scaling
        - Feature Scaling
            - Problem - multiple features
            - Idea - make features on similar scale
            - Goal - get every feature into approximately a -1 ≤ Xᵢ ≤ 1 range
            - Action - divide each value by maximum value
            - Example
                - House Size - size/maximum i.e. size/2000
                - Bedrooms - bedrooms/maximum i.e. bedrooms/5
            - Rule - -3 to +3
        - Mean Normalization
            - Replace Xᵢ with uᵢ (average value of Xᵢ in training set) to make features have approximately zero mean
            - Action replace Xᵢ with (Xᵢ - uᵢ)/ Sᵢ where Sᵢ is the max-min range or standard deviation
            - Example
                - House Size - (size - 1000) / 2000
                - Bedrooms - (bedrooms - 2) / 5
    - Gradient Descent in Practice II: Learning Rate
        - Debugging - How to make sure gradient descent is working correctly
            - Job - find theta that minimizes the cost function
            - Action - plot cost function as gradient descent runs (per iteration)
            - Observation: cost function should decrease after every iteration
            - Observation: when changes reduce/plateau, indicator of convergence 
        - Automatic Convergence Test - declare convergence is cost function decreases by less than 10^-3 in one iteration (difficult)
        - Choosing Alpha
            - Increasing or Cycling then alpha may be too large
            - Gradient descent moving extremely slow, alpha may be too small
            - Try alpha as ... , 0.0001, .0003, 0.01, .03, 0.1, .3, 1, ...
    - Features and Polynomial Regression
        - Combine Features
            - Example - Predicting Price of House
                - Frontage - width of home lot
                - Depth - depth of home lot
                - Extra/United Feature - Area - width x depth of home lot
        - Polynomial Regression - Change Features to Different Functions
            - Set x as feature squared, cubed, etc
            - Issue - Feature Scaling
                - size = 1 - 1000
                - size^2 = 1 - 1000000
                - size ^3 = 1 - 10^9
