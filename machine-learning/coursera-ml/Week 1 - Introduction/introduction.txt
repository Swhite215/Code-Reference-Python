Introduction to Machine Learning Videos

1. What is Machine Learning?
    - Arthur Samuel 1950 - field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicilty programmed
    - Tom Mitchell 1998 - A well posed learning problem, a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T , as measured by P, improves with experience E.
        - Example - Classifying Emails
            - Task - classifying email
            - Experience - watching emails being labeled
            - Performance - fraction of emails correctly classified as spam or not spame
    - Machine Learning Algorithms
        - Supervised Learning - teach computer how to do system
        - Unsupervised Learning - let computer learn by itself
        - Reinforcement Learning
        - Recommender Systems
    - Practical Experience - Best Advice
2. Supervised Learning
    - Essence - algorithm is provided dataset(s) with "right answers" given
    - Problem - regression problem i.e. predict a continuous valued output
    - Problem - classification problem i.e. predict a discrete valued output e.g. 0 or 1
    - Example - Housing Prices
        - Goal - predict housing prices based on size in square feet
        - Type - regression
        - Actions
            - Linear Regression
            - Polynomial Regression
    - Example - Breast Cancer #1
        - Goal - predict whether breast cancer is malignant or benign based on tumor size
        - Type - classification
    - Example - Breast Cancer #2
        -Â Goal - predict whether breast cancer is malignant or benign based on tumor size AND age
        - Type - classification
        - Other Features - Clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape
    - Support Vector Machine - to be introduced soon, enables high number of features
3. Unsupervised Learning
    - Essence - algorithm is provided dataset with no labels or answers
    - Problem - clustering problem i.e. grouping data into clusters
    - Problem - cocktail party problem i.e. separate streams of data being summed, finding structure in a chaotic environment
    - Example - News Articles
        - Goal - Grouping related news articles
        - Type - clustering
    - Example - DNA Microarray Data
        - Goal - Grouping individuals based on genes
        - Type - clustering
    - Example - Computing Clusters
        - Goal - Organize computer clusters for optimacy
        - Type - clustering
    - Example - Social Network
        - Goal - Identify cohesive groups based on social connections
        - Type - clustering
    - Example - Market Segmentation
        - Goal - Discover market segments and groups based on market activity\
        - Type - clustering
    - Example- Astronomical Data
        - Goal - Learn about formations of galleries
        - Type - clustering
