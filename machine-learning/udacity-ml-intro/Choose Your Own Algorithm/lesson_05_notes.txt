Udacity Lesson 05 Choose Your Own Algorithm

1. Algorithm Options
    - K nearest neighbors - classic, simple, easy to understand
    - Adaboost - ensemble method (meta classifier built from decision tree)
    - Random forest - ensemble method (meta classifier built from decision tree)

2. Process
    - Do some research on the algorithm - general understanding
    - Find sklearn documentation for algorithm
    - Deploy the algorithm - get your hands dirty
    - Use it to make predictions
    - Evaluate accuracy of classifier
