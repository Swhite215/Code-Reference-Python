Engineering Probability and Statistics

1. Descriptive Statistics
    a. Population, Sample, Variable
        - Population - a collection of objects of interest in a study
            - Study is which candidate will win an election, population is everyone planning and eligible to vote
            - Study is defect rate of cellphone screen, population is all cellphone screens
        - Sample a subset of the population selected by a defined procedure
            - Study is which candidate will will an election, sample is 500 voters contacted by telephone
        - Variable - a characteristics of interest for the elements
        - Discrete Variables - variables that take finite or countably infinite values
            - Number of rooms in a house
        - Continuous Variables - variable that takes infinitely many uncountable values
            - Size, price
        - Univariate vs. Multivariate
            - Univariate - single variable
            - Multivariate - multiple variables
    b. Four Levels of Measurement
        - Nominal - categorical - names or lables that have no order
            - Country Code, Marital Status, Social Security Number
            - Only math operations are = and !=
        - Ordinal - ranking relationship, go into an order
            - First, Second, Third, Fourth, Stars
            - Math operations include =, !=, <, >
        - Interval - zero is arbitrary, distance between tells us something
            - Date, temperature, GPS coordinates, heading
            - Math Operations - =, !=, <, >, -
        - Ratio - zero is genuine i.e. there is none of what is being measured
            - Dollars, age, speed, length, weight, time duration
            - Math Operations - =, !=, <, >, -, /
    c. Graphical Integrity
        - The Principle of Proportional Ink - the representation of numbers, as physically measureed on the surface of the graphic itself i.e. the amount of ink used, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented
    d. Measures of Location
        - Goal - the measure of the center of the date
        - Sample Mean - sensitive to outliers
        - Sample Median - middle value
        - Quartile/Percentile - seperating bottom nths data from top 1-nth data
        - Trimmed Mean - mean after discarding the smallest and largest a% of data
        - Box Plot - smallest, first quartile, median or second quartile, third quartile, largest data
        - Descriptive Statistics with Python
    e. Measures of Variability
        - Goal - the measure of the spread of the data
        - Range - difference between largest and smallest value and is sensitive to outliers
        - Interquartile Range - third quartile - first quartile
        - Deviations from the mean
            - Average Deviation - sum of all deviations is always zero so does not work
            - Absolute Deviation - prevents a problem with differentiation at values of zero
            - Squared Deviation - preferred approach with smooth graph
        - Sample Variance - sum of squared differences / n - 1
        - Sample Standard Deviation - square root of sample variance
        - Why divided by n-1? Degree of freedom, -1 to account for issue with average deviation
        - Properties
            - #1 - adding a constant to the data would shift the distribution right or left without changing the shape
            - #2 - multiplying a constant with the data would scale the distribution by that factor
    f. Data Visualzation
        - Graphics reveal data
        - Anscombe's Quartet demonstrates this perfectly
        - Historgram - relative frequency = frequency / total # of data points

2. Probability
    a. Sample Space, Events
        - Sample Space - set that describes all possible outcomes in an experiment, it must be collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive
            - Flip a Coin Once - {H, T}
            - Flip a Coin Twice - {H-H, T-T, H-T, T-H}
        - Event - a collection of outcomes in the sample space or simply a subset of the sample space
        - Simple Event - consists of a single outcome
            - Roll two dice and the total is 12
            - Basketball player takes and makes both free throws
        - Compount Event - consists of multiple outcomes
            - Roll two dice and get a duoble
            - Roll a die and it lands on an odd number
            - Basketball player makes at least one free throw of two taken

    b. Set Operations
        - Union - event consisting of all outcomes that are either in A or in B
        - Intersection - event consisting of all outcomes that are in both A and B
        - Commutative Property - A+B=B+A, A*B=B*A
        - Associative Property - (A+B)+C=A+(B+C), (A*B)*C=A*(B*C)
        - Distributive Property - (A+B)*C=(A*C)+(B*C)
        - Mutually Exclusive or Disjoint Events
        - Complement of An Event - The set of all outcomes that are not in A
        - Subset - An event A is a subset of an event B if all outcomes in A are also outcomes in B
        - DeMorgan's Law I - Not (A and B) is the same as Not A or Not B
        - DeMorgan's Law II - Not (A or B) is the same as Not A and Not B.

    c. Probability Axioms
        - Probability - a number that encodes our knowledge or belief about the collective likelihood of the elements of A
        - Axiom #1 - Non-Negativity - P(A) >= 0, for any event A
        - Axiom #2 - Normalizations - P(Omega) = 1
        - Axiom #3 - Additivity - if AnB = , then P(AuB) = P(A) + P(B)
        - General Additivity - P(A) + P(B) + P(B)
        - Proofs - Notes

    d. Product Rule
        - Discrete Probability Law - if sample space is finite, then the probability of any event P(E) = sum of probabilities of its elements
        - Discrete Uniform Probability Law - if all outcomes are equally likely, then P(A) is the number of outcomes of A over the total number of outcomes in the sample space
        - Examples
            - Roll a die twice, how many pairs of numbers are possible? 6x6 = 36
        - The Product Rule
            - n1 results of the first step
            - n2 results of the second step
            - Total possible is n1xn2

    e. Permuation
        - Definition - to arrange in a different order, an ordering of distinguishable objects
        - Simple Example
            - Goal - rank two teams A and B
            - Answer - Two - AB, BA
        - Simple Example Two
            - Goal - rank three teams A, B, and C
            - Answer - Six - ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CBA, CAB
        - Equation - n!/(n-k)!

    f. Combination
        - Simple Example
            - Goal - choose 2 students from 5 to volunteer this weekend, how many possible ways to choose?
            - Do this graphically!
            - Answer - 10, order doesn't matter
        - Definition - an unordered subet
        - Simple Example Two
            - Goal - Choose 3 students from 40 to form a committee, how many possible ways?
            - Action One - How many ways to form the committee? 40!/(40-3)!
            - Action Two - How many ways to order each chosen 3 students? 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 or 3! 
            - Action Three - Divide ways by duplicates - 40!/(40-3)!3!
        - Equation - n!/(n-k)!k!
        - Property One
            - (n CHOOSE k) = (n choose n-k)
        - Example Three
            - Goal - in a round robin tennis tournament with n players, each player meets every other player exactly once, how many games need to be played?

    g. Conditional Probability
        - Simple Example
            - D - Roll a die, told it landed on an odd, what is the probability it is less than 4?
            - Action One - consider only odd
            - Action Two - consider less than 4
            - Answer - 2/3
        - Equation - P(A|B) = P(A N B)/P(B)
        - Simplify P(A|B)
            - A and B are disjoint - 0
            - A c B - P(A) / P(B)
            - B c A - P(B) / P(B) = 1
            - A = B - 1

    h. Multiplication Rule
        - Start Equation - P(A|B) = P(A N B)/P(B)
        - Derived - P(A N B) = P(B)* P(A|B)
        - Additional - P(A n B n C) = P(A) * P(B|A) * P(C | A n B)

    i. Total Probability Theorem
        - Partition - collection of events that are disjoint and their union is the set of all events
        - A and A' always form a partition of sample space
        - Theorem - B = (A1 n B) u (A2 n B) u ... u (An n B)

    j. Baye's Theorem
        - Conditional Probability - P(A|B) = P(AnB)/P(B)
        - Multiplication Rule - P(AnB) = P(A)P(B|A)
        - Bayes Theorem - P(A|B) = P(A)P(B|A)/P(B)

            - When to Use
                - You have a hypothesis, you observe some evident, and you want to know the probability your hypothesis is correct given the new evidence
                - Farming Example
                    - Hypothesis - description of librarian
                    - Prior - Probability Someone is a Librarian vs a Farmer 1/21
                    - Likelihood - limit your view, consider portion of librarians that fit this description given the evidence
                    - Consider probablity of seeing the evidence, given the hypothesis is not true
                - P(H|E) = P(H)P(E|H) / P(E)
                - Important to always consider case where hypothesis is true, and it isn't
                - P(H|E) - Posterior, belief about the hypothesis after seeing the evidence
                - Lets you quantity and systemize the idea of changing beliefs
                - When you see evidence, the space of possibilites gets restricted. When likelihoods are different that is when your beliefs change it alot.
                - Read it geometrically, area of hypothesis times evidence given the hypothesis
            - Linda Example
                - Description
                - Options
                    - Linda is a bank teller
                    - Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement
                    - Key Question without consideration for description, how likely is it a bank teller is a woman and is active in a feminist movement
                    - Insight - option two is a subset and ultimately has to be smaller, bank teller is more statistically likely
                    - *40 out of something is better at kicking are intuitions into gear than 40%
                    - Geometry is exceedingly helpful at visiualizations proportions, which is statitics
            - Evidence should not determine our beliefs, they should update them

    k. Independence
        - Definition - not subject to control by others, not relying on something else
        - Mathematical Definition - P(A|B) = P(A)
        - Equation - P(A) = P(AnB)/P(B) or P(AnB) = P(A)P(B)
        - Simple Example
            - Roll a die twice, first roll lands on 3, second lands on 4, are A and B independent?
            - Answer - yes
        - Property - If A and B are independent, so are A and B'
        - Independence of Three Events
            - A and B are independent
            - B and C are independent
            - Are A And C independent? No
        - Pairwise Independent
            - A and B are independent - P(AnB) = P(A)P(B)
            - B and C are independent - P(BnC) = P(B)P(C)
            - C and A are independent - P(CnA) = P(C)P(A)
            - What about P(AnBnC)?
        - Mutually Independent
            - P(AnB) = P(A)P(B)
            - P(BnC) = P(B)P(C)
            - P(CnA) = P(C)P(A)
            - P(AnBnC) = P(A)P(B)P(C)
