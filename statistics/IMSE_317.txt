Engineering Probability and Statistics

1. Descriptive Statistics
    a. Population, Sample, Variable
        - Population - a collection of objects of interest in a study
            - Study is which candidate will win an election, population is everyone planning and eligible to vote
            - Study is defect rate of cellphone screen, population is all cellphone screens
        - Sample a subset of the population selected by a defined procedure
            - Study is which candidate will will an election, sample is 500 voters contacted by telephone
        - Variable - a characteristics of interest for the elements
        - Discrete Variables - variables that take finite or countably infinite values
            - Number of rooms in a house
        - Continuous Variables - variable that takes infinitely many uncountable values
            - Size, price
        - Univariate vs. Multivariate
            - Univariate - single variable
            - Multivariate - multiple variables
    b. Four Levels of Measurement
    c. Graphical Integrity
    d. Measures of Location
    e. Measures of Variability
    f. Data Visualzation

2. Probability
    a. Sample Space, Events
    b. Set Operations
    c. Probability Axioms
    d. Product Rule
    e. Permuation
