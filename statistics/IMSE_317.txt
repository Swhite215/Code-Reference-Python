Engineering Probability and Statistics

1. Descriptive Statistics
    a. Population, Sample, Variable
        - Population - a collection of objects of interest in a study
            - Study is which candidate will win an election, population is everyone planning and eligible to vote
            - Study is defect rate of cellphone screen, population is all cellphone screens
        - Sample a subset of the population selected by a defined procedure
            - Study is which candidate will will an election, sample is 500 voters contacted by telephone
        - Variable - a characteristics of interest for the elements
        - Discrete Variables - variables that take finite or countably infinite values
            - Number of rooms in a house
        - Continuous Variables - variable that takes infinitely many uncountable values
            - Size, price
        - Univariate vs. Multivariate
            - Univariate - single variable
            - Multivariate - multiple variables
    b. Four Levels of Measurement
        - Nominal - categorical - names or lables that have no order
            - Country Code, Marital Status, Social Security Number
            - Only math operations are = and !=
        - Ordinal - ranking relationship, go into an order
            - First, Second, Third, Fourth, Stars
            - Math operations include =, !=, <, >
        - Interval - zero is arbitrary, distance between tells us something
            - Date, temperature, GPS coordinates, heading
            - Math Operations - =, !=, <, >, -
        - Ratio - zero is genuine i.e. there is none of what is being measured
            - Dollars, age, speed, length, weight, time duration
            - Math Operations - =, !=, <, >, -, /
    c. Graphical Integrity
        - The Principle of Proportional Ink - the representation of numbers, as physically measureed on the surface of the graphic itself i.e. the amount of ink used, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented
    d. Measures of Location
    e. Measures of Variability
    f. Data Visualzation

2. Probability
    a. Sample Space, Events
    b. Set Operations
    c. Probability Axioms
    d. Product Rule
    e. Permuation
